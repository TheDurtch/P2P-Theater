The goal of P2P-Theater is the ability to stream movies from your PC to your friends PC so you can watch it together.
It will not be like Popcorn Time and allow you to watch exsisting torrents.
The content MUST exist on the hosts PC.

Future plan once this gets traction:
Add Music streaming support.
Add Picture sharing support.
Add Live Desktop sharing.
